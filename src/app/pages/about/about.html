          I’m a frontend developer who loves building fast, elegant, and user-focused web applications.
          With hands-on experience in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, I create responsive
          interfaces that blend clean code with thoughtful design.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background in UI design and animation gives me a creative edge — I pay attention to detail,
          motion, and accessibility while keeping performance and scalability in mind.
          I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and refining how I build for the modern web.
